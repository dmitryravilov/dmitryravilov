# Lead Backend Engineer

Backend systems, APIs, and reliable applications

## About

Senior PHP developer and team lead. More than 6 years have been focused on backend development, with solid frontend experience and a background in QA automation that still shapes how I think about quality and reliability. Over the years, I’ve built and maintained customer‑scoring engines, loyalty platforms, regulatory systems, and secure banking integrations.

I’ve taken part in audits, worked through complex data migrations, and spent plenty of time untangling long‑running systems so they stay fast, stable, and easier to maintain. I review pull requests and set clear standards.

Most of my work is in PHP with Laravel, alongside Vue.js. I work with Docker on a daily basis for local development and deployments. Sometimes I use Go in my side projects and in smaller backend services when I need something simple and fast.

I’m open to remote B2B contract opportunities worldwide and enjoy working with distributed teams where reliability and scalability matter most.
