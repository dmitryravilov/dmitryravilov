# Senior PHP / Laravel Developer

Backend systems, APIs, and reliable applications

## About

I’m a backend developer with more than 6 years of experience, mainly working with PHP and Laravel.

Most of my work has been around financial platforms: payments, scoring, compliance tools, and internal business systems. I also have a background in QA automation, which taught me to pay close attention to quality, testing, and long term reliability.

I enjoy improving existing systems, simplifying complex logic, and helping teams keep a high engineering standard.
